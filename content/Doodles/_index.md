**In my spare time, I enjoy creating illustrations and doodles. I have now started attending workshops to improve my digital drawing skills and to experiment a little with different styles. The tool used is Procreate.** 


### Here are some of my doodles:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 16px;">
  <img src="/images/illustrations/HobbitDoor.png" alt="Doodle 1" width="200"/>
  <img src="/images/illustrations/Landscape.png" alt="Doodle 2" width="200"/>
  <!-- Add more images as needed -->
</div>
