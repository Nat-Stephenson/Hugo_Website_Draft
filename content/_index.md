### Hello, and welcome to my little corner of madness and experimentation.

**My name is Nat, curiousity absolutely has gotten the better of me, so here I am building my own little space in Hugo**

**This will mean that I will not know what I am actually achieving alot of the time, I will get it wrong most of the time, but I know that this will be something that will bring me happiness in the long term. I am also 100% certain that I will be increasing my consumption of chocolate over the next couple of months as I explore and experience the AHHHH!, Ohhhhhhh, and YAY! moments of learning a new skill.**

**I don't think that my little adventure will be interesting reading for all, and that is okay! Buuttt if you feel like following me down this rabbit hole, I will always be grateful of the company.**
