**This is my digital sketchbook and journal, a place where I'll be documenting my creative journey, experiments, learning experiences, and personal projects. This space will focus around product & project management and methodologies, as well as my personal interests in doodling and digital art.**

**As I dive into the worlds of agile frameworks, user engagement and creative design, I'll be sharing my learning journey right here.**

**Join me as I stumble my way through the intricacies of product management, explore the nuances of user engagement, and unleash my creativity through doodling and digital art- expect a lot of AHHHHH!, Ohhhhhhh, and YAY! moments along the way.**
