### Hello, and welcome to my little corner of madness and experimentation.

**My name is Nat, and this is my first attempt at using HUGO! I will admit that I have absolutely no clue whether this shall work, nor if I am even doing this right- I am not from a data background and so really this is just me blundering through and learning about something that I am very interested in.** 

**I am really doing this to prove that I can. This will mean that I will not know what I am actually achieving 80% of the time, I will get it wrong at least 90% of the time, but I know that this will be something that will make me smile in the long term. I am also 100% certain that I will be increasing my consumption of chocolate over the next couple of months as I explore and experience the AHHHH!, Ohhhhhhh, and YAY! moments of learning a new skill.**

**I don't think that my little adventure will be interesting reading for all, and that is okay! Buuttt if you feel like following me down this rabbit hole, I will always be grateful of the company.**
